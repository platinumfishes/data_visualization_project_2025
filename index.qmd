#### Abstract

This project transforms **4,337 field-level reports of violence against humanitarian workers** into a structured, interactive intelligence product for crisis awareness and global security insight. Spanning nearly three decades (1997–2025) and over 90 countries, the dataset reveals **geographic escalation, changing actor behavior, and systemic vulnerabilities** in humanitarian operations.

We explore how local aid workers disproportionately face higher rates of violence, how certain regions have become chronically unsafe for intervention, and how the **means and motives of attacks** have evolved — from targeted kidnappings to mass-casualty bombings. The result is a data-driven narrative that not only informs historical understanding but also equips future risk forecasting, mission planning, and policy intervention.

Our dashboard serves as both an analytical artifact and a prototype for what **real-time field intelligence** could look like — bridging the gap between static reporting and dynamic decision-making.

## Implications of Our Research

Humanitarian access is **not just constrained by conflict—it’s under attack**.

Between 1997 and 2025, over **4,300 incidents** of violence against aid workers have been recorded across **90+ countries**. The data reveals a grim pattern:

- **National staff** face over 80% of fatalities and kidnappings, often without adequate protection.
- **Ambushes and roadside attacks** are the most frequent and deadly contexts.
- **Non-state armed groups** — including the Taliban, Al-Itihaad, and LRA — are key perpetrators, driven by political motives or ransom demands.
- Most incidents occur in **Somalia, Sudan, Afghanistan, Iraq, and DRC**, with spikes aligned to major geopolitical events.
- A significant number of attacks remain **unverified and unpunished**, reflecting legal and accountability gaps.

This project provides a foundation for:
- **Risk-aware operational planning**
- **Targeted protections for national staff**
- **Policy advocacy grounded in field-level data**

What emerges is not just a dataset — but a **map of global vulnerability**, and a call to safeguard humanitarian space.
