Humanitarian work is dangerous not just because of where it's done — but **how** those who serve are targeted. This section explores the weapons, tactics, and circumstances behind attacks on aid workers.

From roadside ambushes to raids on compounds, the dataset reveals stark patterns. Certain methods like **shootings and kidnappings** occur frequently, while others — **IEDs and landmines** — are less common but far more deadly. The **context** of these attacks also matters: are they premeditated raids, spontaneous mob violence, or the result of indiscriminate warfare?

## Most Common Methods of Attack

</div>

This visualization shows the top methods used to target aid workers between 1997 and 2024. **Shootings**, **kidnappings**, and **bodily assaults** dominate the threat landscape — often occurring during field movement or in insecure urban environments.

Notably, while methods like **IEDs**, **bombings**, and **sexual violence** appear less frequently, they are often more deadly or traumatic in effect. The diversity of methods also reflects regional conflict dynamics, ranging from guerrilla warfare to criminal targeting.

## Most Lethal Methods of Attack

</div>

This lollipop chart compares the **average fatalities per incident** across all attack methods from 1997 to 2024. Each method is represented by a vertical line and a dot, with **dot size scaled to the total number of reported incidents**.

Key insights:
- **Aerial bombardment**, **complex attacks**, and **landmines** rank among the most lethal on a per-incident basis — even if relatively rare.
- **Shootings** and **kidnappings**, while more common, result in fewer fatalities per attack on average.
- The visual contrast between **frequency** (dot size) and **severity** (length of line) helps distinguish methods that are **frequent but less deadly** vs. **rare but devastating**.

This view reveals a critical operational insight: the **most common threats aren't always the deadliest** — and vice versa — requiring nuanced mitigation strategies that address both prevalence and potential impact.

## Changing Patterns of Violence: Attack Contexts Over Time

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="assets/attacks/context_timeline.png" alt="Stacked area plot showing the evolution of attack contexts from 1997 to 2024" style="width:100%;"/>
</div>

This stacked area chart tracks how the **tactics used against humanitarian workers** have evolved between 1997 and 2024.

Key insights from the visualization:

- **Ambushes** have consistently dominated the threat landscape, reflecting rising dangers during transit and supply missions.
- **Raids on compounds and project sites** surged in the early 2000s — especially in conflict zones like Iraq, Sudan, and Somalia — and appear to be resurging in recent years.
- **Checkpoints and crossfire incidents** remain persistent, highlighting the **blurred lines between combatants and civilians** in contested areas.
- The diversity of tactics has grown over time, reflecting increasingly **complex, targeted, and premeditated** forms of violence.

Understanding these shifting contexts helps operational planners anticipate **not just where**, but **how** aid workers are likely to be attacked — and build protection protocols accordingly.

## The Mechanics of Targeting

Three systemic patterns emerge from how aid workers are attacked:

1. **Predictable Contexts, Vulnerable Moments**  
Aid workers are most often targeted in **ambushes**, **checkpoints**, and **compound raids** — not random attacks, but scenarios where they are **highly visible and minimally protected**. Transit routes, office sites, and aid distribution hubs remain the most common flashpoints.

2. **Disproportionate Lethality of Rare Tactics**  
While **shootings** and **bodily assaults** dominate numerically, it is the **less frequent methods** — like **aerial bombardments**, **landmines**, and **complex attacks** — that account for the **highest death tolls** per incident [@AidWorkerSecurity2023; @ICRC_Somalia1997].

3. **Shifting Tactical Landscapes**  
The timeline shows that **new contexts emerge as conflict dynamics evolve**. The 2000s saw a rise in compound raids, the 2010s in roadside ambushes, and the 2020s are now marked by complex hybrid attacks and sieges on urban health facilities [@MSF_SouthSudan2017; @BBC_Gaza2023].
