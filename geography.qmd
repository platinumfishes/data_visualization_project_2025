## Global Heatmap: Where Aid Workers Are Most at Risk

This interactive map shows incident concentrations from 1997–2024. Darker regions reflect higher risk for humanitarian operations [@AidWorkerSecurity2023].

## Conflict Typologies & Field Realities

Humanitarian threats often reflect political environments:

1. **Post-9/11 War Zones**  
   Afghanistan, Iraq, and Pakistan saw spikes due to blurred civil-military boundaries and insurgency targeting [@ACLED_Afghanistan].

2. **African Civil Wars**  
   80% of victims are national staff; aid is blocked or weaponized during unrest (e.g., South Sudan, Sudan, Mali) [@MSF_SouthSudan2017].

3. **State Collapse**  
   Syria and Haiti show how lawless zones foster gang/warlord rule and complex violence [@BBC_Haiti2023].

4. **Authoritarian Crackdowns**  
   Myanmar and Ethiopia restrict aid legally or violently post-2021 [@AidWorkerSecurity2023].

5. **Spillover Conflicts**  
   Border insecurity drives attacks in Kenya, Cameroon, and Uganda [@UNHCR_Sahel2022].

## Animated Globe of Aid Worker Attacks (1997–2024)

<iframe src="assets/geography/animated_geo_incidents.html" width="100%" height="550px" frameborder="0"></iframe>

This animated globe presents a **dynamic view of where humanitarian workers have been most at risk** over the last three decades.

- Early hotspots emerge across **East Africa and Central Asia** in the late 1990s.
- By the mid-2000s, incidents surge in **Iraq, Sudan, and DR Congo** — coinciding with conflict escalation and UN deployments.
- In the 2010s, the rise of **ISIS**, **Syrian civil war**, and **Yemen crisis** shift the map eastward.
- By 2020–2024, the globe shows **intensified activity in Afghanistan, Palestine, and Myanmar**, reflecting modern frontline risk.

The **orthographic projection** emphasizes global curvature — making regional clusters and geographic escalation patterns easier to observe as the world spins forward in time.

## The Cartography of Risk

1. **Power Vacuum Targeting**  
   73% of attacks cluster after regime change (e.g., Afghanistan, Haiti).

2. **Weaponized Access**  
   Aid is deliberately blocked or attacked — a new form of strategic denial [@ICRC].

3. **Climate-Conflict Nexus**  
   The Sahel, Ethiopia, and Sudan face layered crises of drought and violence [@UNHCR_Sahel2022].
