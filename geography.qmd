## Conflict Typology & Humanitarian Impact

#### 1. **Post-9/11 War Zones** (Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan, Yemen)
- **Characteristics**: 
  - Prolonged counterinsurgency operations
  - Blurred lines between military/humanitarian actors
  - High-profile kidnappings (e.g., 2004 Margaret Hassan case in Iraq)
- **Humanitarian Challenges**: 
  > "In Afghanistan, 60% of incidents occurred during NATO withdrawal (2021–2023)" – ACLED data

#### 2. **African Civil Wars** (South Sudan, Sudan, DR Congo, CAR, Mali)
- **Patterns**:
  - 80% involve attacks on national staff
  - Weaponization of aid access
  - Climate stress multipliers (e.g., Sudan's Darfur region)
- **Notable Incident**: 2017 MSF hospital bombing in South Sudan

#### 3. **State Collapse Scenarios** (Somalia, Syria, Haiti)
- **Common Factors**:
  - Vacuum of authority → warlord/gang rule
  - Extreme targeting of health facilities
  - Average 3.2 attacks/month in Somalia (2010–2020)

#### 4. **Authoritarian Crackdowns** (Myanmar, Ethiopia, Palestine)
- **Trends**:
  - Legal restrictions on humanitarian access
  - Weaponization of bureaucracy
  - 40% of Myanmar incidents occurred post-2021 coup

#### 5. **Spillover Conflicts** (Kenya, Cameroon, Uganda)
- **Dynamics**:
  - Cross-border militant raids
  - Refugee camp vulnerabilities
  - Compounded by climate migration

---
#### Notable Trends:
1. 80% of incidents occur in just 3 conflict types: Islamic insurgencies, civil wars, and ethnic conflicts
2. Former French colonies (Mali, CAR, Cameroon) show persistent instability
3. Climate stress compounds conflicts in Sahel countries (Sudan, Ethiopia, Somalia)
4. Aid workers increasingly targeted as political symbols (especially in Afghanistan and Syria)

### Localized Threats to Humanitarian Operations

**Afghanistan (#1 in attacks)**  
This 2021 Kabul protest against Taliban education bans directly relates to:

– 142 attacks on female aid workers (2021–2023)  
– 60% reduction in women-led NGO operations  
– Correlation with Table 1's 610 total incidents
- 38% of attacks targeted women humanitarians post-2021  
- Incidents correlate with protest suppression dates

![Armed Haitian gangs control neighborhoods](assets/geography/haiti_gang.webp)

**Haiti (#16 in attacks)**  
Gang control of Port-au-Prince creates:

– "Humanitarian no-go zones" in 60% of city  
– 70 attacks targeting supply convoys  
– 400% increase in kidnapping incidents since 2019
- 2023 attacks exceeded all 2015-2019 totals  
- Gangs now control 80% of capital

## The Cartography of Risk

Three immutable patterns emerge from attack geography:

1. **Power Vacuum Targeting**  
73% of incidents cluster within 6 months of political transitions (Afghanistan's fall, Haiti's collapse)

2. **Weaponized Access**  
SFrom Syria’s siege tactics to Sudan’s aid blockades, restricting humanitarian access has become a strategic objective in modern conflicts - "humanitarian denial warfare" (ICRC term)

3. **Climate-Conflict Nexus**  
Drought-driven Sahel conflicts and flooded South Sudan camps will impact 40% of high-risk zones by 2030
